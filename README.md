# Capstone Project: BellaBeat Data Analysis & Viz - A Caste study

# Role: Junior Data Analyst at BellaBeat
As part of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project, I worked with BellaBeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart devices for women. My role was to analyze smart device usage data collected from Fitbit to provide insights that would inform BellaBeat’s marketing strategy, focusing on customer behavior trends and feature usage. The project spanned multiple phases, from data cleaning and analysis to deriving actionable recommendations.
# Project Overview:
The goal was to leverage user data from Fitbit devices to help BellaBeat understand patterns in user activity and how these could be utilized to improve product offerings and enhance customer engagement. The dataset included 940 entries from 33 unique users, collected over a span of 31 days. It contained information related to users' physical activities, such as step count, calories burned, and distance covered, along with time spent in different activity levels.
# Data Cleaning & Wrangling:
I began by preparing the dataset for analysis. Using R, I cleaned the data to remove inconsistencies, handled duplicates, and eliminated any columns that were irrelevant to the analysis. Since there were no null values in the dataset, I was able to focus on ensuring that the data was properly merged and aligned across all entries, particularly paying attention to ensuring accurate date-time formatting and categorizing activity levels (e.g., very active, moderately active).
# Analysis & Visualization:
Once the data was cleaned, I conducted an in-depth statistical analysis to uncover meaningful insights about user behavior. The primary focus was on identifying trends related to step count, calorie burn, and various activity intensities (such as very active, lightly active, or sedentary minutes). I calculated key metrics such as average steps per day, total calories burned, and the correlation between physical activity and other metrics.
I used visualization techniques to explore relationships between variables. For instance, scatterplots and line charts showed the relationship between step count and calories burned. Heatmaps were employed to illustrate daily activity patterns across different users. These visualizations provided a clear view of how user activity changed over the days, which helped me identify peak activity times and trends in user persistence (how consistently they used the device).
# Key Insights & Findings:
Through my analysis, I discovered several key insights:
•	High Correlation: There was a strong positive correlation between step count and calories burned, showing that users who were more physically active also expended more energy.
•	Activity Peaks: Most users displayed higher activity levels during weekends, with significant dips during weekdays, indicating a pattern of recreational activity being more prevalent during days off.
•	User Segmentation: By grouping users based on their activity levels, I found that highly active users demonstrated greater device persistence, while more sedentary users tended to use their devices inconsistently.
Actionable Recommendations:
Based on these insights, I made several recommendations to BellaBeat:
1.	Personalized Goals & Notifications: Implement personalized activity goals and motivational notifications to encourage more sedentary users to increase their daily activity.
2.	Sleep Tracking & Stress Management: Expand product features to include sleep analysis and stress management tools, as these are growing areas of interest in wellness tech.
3.	Integration with Other Health Apps: Offer users the ability to integrate their Fitbit data with other health apps to create a more comprehensive wellness ecosystem, fostering increased user engagement.
# Outcome:
This project can be culminated in a presentation to BellaBeat’s founders, where key insights will be highlighted and demonstrate how the data could be used to improve marketing strategies and product offerings. BellaBeat uses targeted recommendations can be used to increase user retention and improve the overall user experience.
